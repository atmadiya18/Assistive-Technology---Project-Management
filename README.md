# Assistive-Technology---Project-Management
Wearable Device for Visually Impaired

The focus of this research project is on individuals with visual impairments, a condition that may arise from various causes including congenital factors, accidents, Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), cataracts, or other serious diseases leading to the loss of vision. The significance of vision in navigating and interpreting the world makes its impairment a profound challenge. However, advancements in technology have paved the way for innovative solutions to assist these individuals in leading more independent and fulfilled lives. Among these solutions, both low-tech and high-tech devices play pivotal roles, ranging from text-to-speech converters to sophisticated systems employing Computer Vision and Image Processing. These technologies are instrumental in safeguarding visually impaired individuals from potential deceit in crowded environments such as markets and tourist destinations.

Given my keen interest in Computer Vision, this project aims to explore and analyze the most recent or ongoing technological advancements that utilize image processing to aid in navigation and improve the quality of life for the visually impaired. The scope of this investigation will include, but not be limited to, customized smart glasses, canes, and wheelchairs designed to address not only blindness but also additional challenges faced by these individuals.

My motivation for selecting this topic stems from personal encounters with numerous individuals who live with visual impairments. Witnessing the challenges they face has not only heightened my awareness but also instilled a profound respect for the innovative solutions developed to assist them. The contributions of scientists and researchers in this field serve as a source of inspiration, and this project is a testament to the potential of technology to make a significant positive impact on the lives of those with visual impairments. Through this research, I aim to contribute to the body of knowledge in this area and explore potential avenues for future advancements.
